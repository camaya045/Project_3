    <h1>Drawings</h1>
      <p>Drawing is one of my favorite ways to pass the time. Most of my inspiration comes from anime.</p>
      <p>Here are some of my personal favorite drawings that I have drawn.</p>
    <div>
      <img src="images/akame1.jpg" alt="A picture of Akame Hinowa holding a katana" >
      <p>This drawing was inspired by the character Akame from the anime <em>Akame ga Kill</em> and is one</p>
      <p>of my favorite drawings that I have made. I chose a specific scene that I liked and did</p>
      <p>my best to draw it and shade it properly.</p>
    </div>
      <h2>Drawing 2</h2>
    <div>
      <img src="images/kiyotaka.jpg" alt="A picture of Ajanokoji Kiyotaka sitting down with a white background" >
      <p>I took inspiration for this drawing from the anime <em>Classroom of The Elite</em>. The character I drew</p> 
      <p>is the main character Ayanokoji, he is portrayed to be smart and composed which is why he is my favorite</p>
      <p>character of the anime. I used an image I found on google to use as reference for his pose.</P> 
    </div>
      <h3>Drawing 3</h3>
    <div>
      <img src="images/mika.jpg" alt="A picture of Mikaela Hyakuya looking back" >
      <p>This drawing is from the anime <em>Seraph of the End</em> anime and the character that I drew</p>
      <p>Mikaela. The anime is about vampires and this charcter was turned into a vampire, and is one of my</p> 
      <p>favorite characters in the show.</P> 
    </div>
      <h4>Other Drawings</h4>
    <div>
