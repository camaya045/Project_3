    <h1>My Drawings</h1>
    <p>Drawing is one of my favorite hobbies. Most of my inspiration comes from anime.</p>
    <p>Here are some of my personal favorite drawings that I have created:</p>

    <!-- Image Slider -->
    <div class="slider">
      <!-- Slide 1 -->
      <div class="slide active">
        <img src="images/akame1.jpg" alt="Akame Hinowa holding a katana from Akame ga Kill">
        <p>
          This drawing was inspired by the character Akame from the anime <em>Akame ga Kill</em>.
          I chose a specific scene that I liked and did my best to draw it and shade it properly.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- Slide 2 -->
      <div class="slide">
        <img src="images/kiyotaka.jpg" alt="Ayanokoji Kiyotaka sitting with a composed expression">
        <p>
          I took inspiration for this drawing from the anime <em>Classroom of The Elite</em>.
          The character I drew is Ayanokoji Kiyotaka, portrayed to be smart and composed, which is why he is my favorite character in the anime.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- Slide 3 -->
      <div class="slide">
        <img src="images/mika.jpg" alt="Mikaela Hyakuya looking back from Seraph of the End">
        <p>
          This drawing is from the anime <em>Seraph of the End</em>. The character Mikaela is a vampire
          and one of my favorite characters in the show.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- Slide 4 -->
      <div class="slide">
        <img src="images/zero_two.jpg" alt="Zero Two in color from Darling in The Franxx">
        <p>
          This is another of my favorite drawings from the anime <em>Darling in The Franxx</em>.
          Zero Two is one of the most iconic characters in anime.
